🔗 [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

### Example

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]

Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]

Output: 2

### Constraints:

n == nums.length

1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4

-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
